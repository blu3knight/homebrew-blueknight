## About 

This personal Homebrew tap serves as an archival repository of tools and formulas that the maintainer has previously used or developed, which are no longer available in the official Homebrew or Homebrew Cask repositires. 

It is intended as a historical record rather than an actively maintained source, with no guarantees of future updates or support. Users are advised to consult official Homebrew taps for current, supported software. 

Since I use the software personally I will try to update this, but there is no timeline associated with it. 

## Why?

If I use the program I am OK with try to maintain it. If the program is removed because it is hard to reach the hosting, then you can download the information yourself.

A lot of time the tools are removed because they are on a private server. I might try to contact the author and see if I can host them on my web server. 

## Updates

There are none. If I have time I will update the acask informaiton.
