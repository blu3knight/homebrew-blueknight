# homebrew-blueknight

## About 

This repository is a history of the tools that I use that is deleted from the homebrew and homebrew cask directory. It does not mean that there is any gaurantee of updates to this directory whatsoever. 

## Why?

If I use the program I am OK with try to maintain it. If the program is removed because it is hard to reach the hosting, then you can download the information yourself.

A lot of time the tools are removed because they are on a private server. I might try to contact the author and see if I can host them on my web server. 

## Updates

There are none. If I have time I will update the acask informaiton.
